# Context

This analysis expands on a previous analysis with a similar objective (**SAR-2023-004-BH-v02**), by employing more flexible modeling strategies to include time-dependent covariates that were dropped from the previous analysis.
In the process the raw FIM scores were substituted by their quartiles.

## Objectives

To determine the effect of socioeconomic status of the neighborhood on mortality of patients with brain injury, accounting for time-dependent covariates.

# Methods

The data procedures, design and analysis methods used in this report are fully described in the annex document **SAP-2023-016-BH-v01**.

<!-- ## Statistical analyses -->

This analysis was performed using statistical software `R` version `r getRversion()`.

# Results

## Study population and follow up

There initially were `r style_number(Nobs_orig)` observations on `r style_number(Nobs_orig_id)` study participants considered for inclusion.
After excluding follow up measurements during the COVID-19 pandemic to mitigate confounding on mortality causes there were `r style_number(Nobs_incl_per)` observations left in the study sample.
After applying the inclusion criteria for the study period between `r study_period[1]` and `r study_period[2]` and considering the status at the last available follow up time for each individual a total of `r style_number(Nobs_final)` participants were included in the analysis.

The epidemiological profile of the participant included in the study was a
male participant (`r inline_text(tab_desc, variable = SexF, level = "Male")`)
with an average (SD) age of `r inline_text(tab_desc, variable = AGE)` years.
<!-- The average (SD) time of follow up was -->
<!-- `r style_number(mean(analytical$Time, na.rm=TRUE), 2)` -->
<!-- (`r style_number(sd(analytical$Time, na.rm=TRUE), 2)`) -->
<!-- years. -->

Races were not homogeneously available in the study population with
`r inline_text(tab_desc, variable = Race, level = "White")` individuals being white;
`r inline_text(tab_desc, variable = Mar, level = "Single (Never Married)")` were single (never married) at the time of injury,
and most participants were well educated with `r inline_text(tab_desc, variable = EDUCATION, level = "Greater Than High School")` at greater than high school level.
A total of `r inline_text(tab_desc, variable = EMPLOYMENT, level = "Employed")` were employed and
`r inline_text(tab_desc, variable = RURALdc, level = "Urban")` participants lived in an urban area.

```{r tab_desc}
tab_desc %>%
  as_kable(              # only for markdown
  # as_flex_table(       # only for DOCX
  # ) %>%
  # flextable::set_caption(
    caption = "**Table 1** Epidemiological, demographic and clinical characteristics of study participants."
  )
```

The observed overall mortality was 13.5% in the study period.
The distribution of cases appear homogeneous across SES quintiles (Figure 1), ranging from 10.6% to 13.5%.
We will test the effect of SES quintiles on the hazard rate in the next section.
See also Figure A2 in the appendix for the distribution of sexes in each SES quintile in the study population.

```

## Time-adjusted effect of SES on mortality

The previous seizure disorder diagnosis was missing for most of the study population and was not included in the model as a covariate to preserve study power.
After excluding participants with missing data from other variables a total of `r style_number(Nobs_model)` complete cases were available for analysis.
The
`r attr(analytical$DAYStoREHABdc, "label")`
<!-- cause of injury -->
<!-- and -->
<!-- both FIM scales -->
<!-- were -->
was
removed from the model due to violations of the proportional hazards assumption (see section 8.2 in the appendix).

The survival curves of both sexes by SES quintiles can be seen in Figure 2.
Overall, the distressed neighborhoods appear to have a lower survival probability then other neighborhoods.
This appears to be true for both sexes, and males had a higher risk of dying than females in all neighborhoods.
This plot was cropped at `r style_percent(crop, symbol = TRUE)` survival for presentation purposes, see Figure A3 in the appendix for an uncropped version.

```{r fig2, fig.cap="**Figure 2** Survival of participants, by sex and by SES quintiles."}
# ![Age](../figures/outcome.png)
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/surv.png", error = FALSE)
```

When considering only the crude effect of SES on mortality neighborhood to which the individuals were discharged was associated with mortality (Table 2).
~~Participants who were discharged to an at-risk neighborhood had increased chance of dying
(HR = `r estimates %>% filter(model== "mod1", term == "At-Risk") %>% pull(estimate) %>% style_number(2)`,
95% CI =
`r estimates %>% filter(model== "mod1", term == "At-Risk") %>% pull(conf.low) %>% style_number(2)`
to
`r estimates %>% filter(model== "mod1", term == "At-Risk") %>% pull(conf.high) %>% style_number(2)`),
when compared to those discharged to a prosperous neighborhood.~~
Participants discharged to a distressed neighborhood also had a higher mortality risk
(HR = `r estimates %>% filter(model== "mod1", term == "Distressed") %>% pull(estimate) %>% style_number(2)`,
95% CI =
`r estimates %>% filter(model== "mod1", term == "Distressed") %>% pull(estimate) %>% style_number(2)`
to
`r estimates %>% filter(model== "mod1", term == "Distressed") %>% pull(estimate) %>% style_number(2)`),
when compared to those discharged to a prosperous neighborhood.

Notes:

- ~~note drift of point estimates toward the null~~
- note reliability of precision / CIs lengths don't change much
- possible evidence of confounding of the effect, after controlling for clinical + geo
- multiple: time-varying exposure is associated with the outcome up to model 5
- interaction: association with FIMMOTD, but not FIMCOGD
- interaction: direct association is lost when considering interactions (is it pulling the effect?)

  # ) %>%
  # flextable::set_caption(
    caption = "**Table 2** Effect of SES on mortality; HR estimates were adjusted for sex, race, age, education, employment status, rehabilitation payer, spinal cord injury, substance abuse, FIM scores quartiles, residence after rehab discharge, urbanization and stratified by cause of injury."
  )

range_crude <- tab_inf$tbls[[1]]$table_body$estimate %>% range(na.rm = TRUE) %>% style_number(2)
range_adj   <- tab_inf$tbls[[2]]$table_body$estimate %>% range(na.rm = TRUE) %>% style_number(2)
range_late  <- tab_inf$tbls[[3]]$table_body$estimate %>% range(na.rm = TRUE) %>% style_number(2)
```

<!-- The more variables are controlled for, the more this effect gradually disappears. -->
<!-- It can only be consistently detected after controlling for demographic variables in at-risk and distressed neighborhoods. -->
<!-- Additionally controlling for clinical (model 3) and geographical covariates (model 4) all estimates converge towards the null hypothesis. -->

<!-- The point estimates for all adjusted estimates of SES effect range from `r range_adj[1]` to `r range_adj[2]`, relative to the prosperous neighborhood, and that represents a narrower range of point estimates than the crude estimates (from `r range_crude[1]` to `r range_crude[2]`). -->

<!-- When considering only late deaths the SES effect is not significantly associated with mortality, and estimates relative to a prosperous neighborhood range -->
<!-- from `r range_late[1]` to `r range_late[2]` -->
<!-- (which is an even narrower range than the crude estimates). -->
<!-- The adjusted estimates of all-time mortality can be compared with late mortality where in all neighborhoods the CI of the adjusted estimate is contained within the late death CI's, except for mid-tier and distressed neighborhoods that exceed the respective upper ranges of confidence by a diminute margin (presumably due to precision and study power). -->
<!-- The respective point estimates in most cases do not change by a large amount, where most differences fall under 0.1 HR, with the exception of at-risk neighborhoods. -->
<!-- In the latter both the difference and the CI indicate higher estimates which, although not consistently detectable, is in line with the crude estimate for these neighborhoods, which has a difference of -->
<!-- `r style_number(abs(exp(coef(mod.final)["exposureAt-Risk"]) - exp(coef(mod.late)["exposureAt-Risk"])), 2)` HR. -->
<!-- It can be concluded that effect of SES on the risk of late death is not substantially different from all-time death in the study population, after controlling for all covariates. -->

# Observations and Limitations

**Recommended reporting guideline**

The adoption of the EQUATOR network (<http://www.equator-network.org/>) reporting guidelines have seen increasing adoption by scientific journals.
All observational studies are recommended to be reported following the STROBE guideline (von Elm et al, 2014).

<!-- In particular when a retrospective study is conducted using hospital records, it is recommended that the RECORD extension of the STROBE guideline is considered (Benchimol et al, 2015). -->

# Conclusions

The epidemiological profile of the study participant is an 31 years old white male, that has greater than high school level of education, is actively employed and lives in an urban setting.

There appears to be a crude effect of SES on mortality, where participants that were discharged to either a comfortable or a distressed neighborhood had increased risk of death when compared to those discharged to a prosperous neighborhood.
After controlling for other variables there is no association between SES and mortality.

<!-- Both early deaths and late deaths appear to occur at similar rates across all neighborhoods. -->

## Modeling strategy

### Approaches to control for time-dependent covariates

#### Before location/SES imputation

Imputation was done in a separate analysis and is described in the report **SAR-2023-017-v01**.

##### Schoenfeld and Martingale residuals

```{r A4, fig.cap="**Figure A4** caption"}
# ![Age](../figures/distr_age.png)
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/diag_full-sch.png", error = FALSE)
```

```{r A5, fig.cap="**Figure A5** caption"}
# ![Age](../figures/distr_age.png)
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/diag_full-mar.png", error = FALSE)
```

Notes:

- cause, days, fimmot and fimcog are time-dependent (fail schoenfeld test) (A4)
- a few observations might be outliers, but do not appear to be influential (A5)

##### Martingale residuals of covariates against the null model

```{r A6, fig.cap="**Figure A6** caption"}
# ![Age](../figures/distr_age.png)
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/diag_null_cause-mar.png", error = FALSE)
```

```{r A7, fig.cap="**Figure A7** caption"}
# ![Age](../figures/distr_age.png)
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/diag_null-mar.png", error = FALSE)
```

Notes:

- Cause has an extreme non-PH violation, falls are much higher risk (A6)
- this justifies stratifying by Cause
- individuals with lower days/fimmot/fimcog have higher non-PH risk (A7)
- days is much worse than FIM scores (highly non-linear) (A7)

##### Stratification by cause of injury

```{r A8, fig.cap="**Figure A8** caption"}
# ![Age](../figures/distr_age.png)
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/diag_strat-sch.png", error = FALSE)
```

Notes:

- stratifying by cause helps with non-PH of the 3 vars (A8)

##### Time split

```{r A9, fig.cap="**Figure A9** caption"}
# ![Age](../figures/distr_age.png)
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/diag_full_split-sch.png", error = FALSE)
```

Notes:

- time split at 1yr doesn't help further (A9)

##### Non-linear fitting

```{r A10, fig.cap="**Figure A10** caption"}
# ![Age](../figures/distr_age.png)
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/diag_poly-sch.png", error = FALSE)
```

```{r A11, fig.cap="**Figure A11** caption"}
# ![Age](../figures/distr_age.png)
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/diag_spline-sch.png", error = FALSE)
```

Notes:

- polynomials (A10) and splines (A11) appear to help stabilize residuals, but not enough

##### Interaction with time

```{r A12, fig.cap="**Figure A12** caption"}
# ![Age](../figures/distr_age.png)
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/diag_time-sch.png", error = FALSE)
```

Notes:

- makes non-PH worse, not helpful at all (A12)

##### FIM scores quartiles

```{r A13, fig.cap="**Figure A13** caption"}
# ![Age](../figures/distr_age.png)
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/diag_full_q-sch.png", error = FALSE)
```

Notes:

- days still non-PH (A13)
- FIM scores seem PH enough (A13)

#### Best model specification

```{r A14, fig.cap="**Figure A14** caption"}
# ![Age](../figures/distr_age.png)
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/diag_strat_q_nodays-sch.png", error = FALSE)
```

Notes:

- removing days makes residuals appear PH (A14)
- passes schoenfeld test
- final model: strat by cause + FIM quartiles + drop days

<!-- ### After location/SES imputation -->

### Schoenfeld test

```{r}
sch.df %>%
  kable(
    caption = "**Table A1** caption"
  )
```


### Final model specification

```{r tab_app}
tab_app %>%
  as_kable(              # only for markdown
  # as_flex_table(       # only for DOCX
  # ) %>%
  # flextable::set_caption(
    caption = "**Table A2** Alternative version of Table 2, showing effects from all covariates included in the models."
  )
```
